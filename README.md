In this project you will take everything that you have learned for processing point clouds, and use it to detect car and trucks on a narrow street using lidar. The detection pipeline should follow the covered methods, filtering, segmentation, clustering, and bounding boxes. Also the segmentation, and clustering methods should be created from scratch using the previous lessonâ€™s guidelines for reference. The finished result will look like the image below, placing bounding boxes around all obstacles on the road.
